## Project Description

In this project, I was responsible for developing an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of the performance of a company's digital marketing campaigns. The dashboard was designed with the main purpose of enabling end users, such as marketing managers and executives, to make data-driven decisions related to budget allocation and marketing strategies.

Contribution:

- Dynamic Data Segmentation: Users can filter data by product category, customer demographics, and geographic location, enabling more specific and relevant analysis.

- Social Media Spending Analysis: An intuitive doughnut visualization displays the company's investment on various social media platforms, providing insights into the effectiveness of ad spend.

- Product Performance Analysis: Detailed bar charts outline the total sales, costs, and profits of individual products, highlighting opportunities and challenges within the product portfolio.

- Real-Time Trends: Line graphs representing historical data and current trends allow users to monitor campaign performance over time and respond quickly to changing market conditions.

- User-Friendly Design: The dashboard is designed with an intuitive interface, ensuring that key information is easily accessible and understandable to all levels of users.

The dashboard has successfully provided accurate and timely insights, which has helped the company improve marketing campaign ROI and optimize budget allocation. In addition, the tool has become a critical component in the company's data-driven decision-making strategy.
